# FinalProject
An E-Commerce website

Hello! This is Shithi Sharma Bindu. Welcome to the description of my very first website. Basically, my website is a simple e-commerce website. In this file I have tried to explain what I have done in this project.
Features provided: 
•	Registration Page
•	Login Page
•	Home
•	New Arrivals
•	Products
•	Review
•	Log out
•	Sign out
•	Cart


**Technologies I used for this project are:**
**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Javascript
**Backend:** MysqL


**Registration Page:** This is the first page you will see in this website. This page will ask for your information like First Name, Last Name, Email id, Password, Date of Birth. After filling all this you can submit your information, and it will directly take you to the login page. But if you are already registered, you can directly go to the Log in page by clicking Log in HERE. If you try to register with same email id but with different other information, it will show that email id already exists. It will not let you do so.

**Login Page:** This is a simple page. After this page the home page comes. Here you can log in with email id and password what you have given while registering. If you put wrong email id , it will show you user does not exist. And if you put wrong password, it will show you that the password is incorrect.
